# Flutter App Getting Started

The Flutter App for PhoneBot is located [here](https://github.com/vi-robotics/phonebot_flutter). The App needs to be built and run on a phone, and the best instructions for how to set up Flutter and install an app are located on their site [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). There you can set up your development environment and build a sample app. Once that is complete, simply open the directory in whatever editor you're using for flutter (or navigate to the director in command line if applicable) and build/install the app.
