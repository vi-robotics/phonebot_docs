# Android App Getting Started

The PhoneBot Android app is located [here](https://github.com/vi-robotics/phonebot_android). Similar to the Flutter app, once Android Studio is configured, installing and building is as simple as plugging in your phone (and changing relevant dev settings) and pressing the install button in Android Studio.
